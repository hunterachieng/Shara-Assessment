# Admin Dashboard 

## Introduction

The Admin Dashboard was a project initiated to make it easy for the employees at Shara to view and interpret the data from our customers. 
The dashboard is a web based platform created using the React Framework and Ant Design for the styling.

After researching and debating between AntDesign and Material UI, I chose to use AntDesign as it offeres a lot of comprehensive UI patterns that are not available in MaterialDesign, and contains less code which makes it fast to implement.

## Features

### Accordion

The CRM contains an accordion within the table in the users section that is used to display more details about the user. The accordion was created from Ant Design where a click of a button opens the section with the extra details.


### Side Navigation

The dashboard contains a responsive side navigation that gives the users a seamless user experience when navigating through the site.

## Side Note:

The dashboard is currently static with dummy data as no API integrations have been done yet, but will be soon. Regardless of this situation, the displayed designs and behavior are to be expected when integrations are complete.
